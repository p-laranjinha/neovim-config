# neovim-config

This config was heavily inspired by [radleylewis's nvim repo](https://github.com/radleylewis/nvim) which includes a 3 part youtube tutorial ([Part 1: Install, Keymaps, Lazy & Plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdAMq2KcF4w); [Part 2: LSP, Linters, Formatters, AI Assist & Completion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1OcolI6x0); [Part 3: TMUX, Git & Debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN4Zbs0ypwM)).

I've also gotten help with defining keymaps from [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/keymaps).
